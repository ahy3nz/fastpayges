    "[OpenMM](http://openmm.org/) is \"A high performance toolkit for molecular simulation. Use it as a library, or as an application. We include extensive language bindings for Python, C, C++, and even Fortran. The code is open source and actively maintained on Github, licensed under MIT and LGPL. Part of the Omnia suite of tools for predictive biomolecular simulation.\" Here's their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/openmm/openmm), and [Conda link](https://anaconda.org/omnia/openmm), though I think they might be relocating their channel to conda-forge.\n",

    "Here's my opinion, OpenMM is a very powerful, flexible engine that has integration with a variety of other MD engines, supports a variety of molecular models, excellent GPU support, active open-source development, and is the underlying molecular dynamics engine for OpenForceField efforts, but very easy to port to other MD engines via ParmEd. There's also support for enhanced sampling and integration with deep learning libraries. If there was a 21st century, best-software-practices, open-source software for molecular modelling and simulation, OpenMM (or HOOMD) would likely be it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, I'm not sure how many graduate students/academic labs opt to use OpenMM if the lab has historically used another MD engine. Also, this is a somewhat unfounded observation, but I'm curious if/how much the computer-aided drug design industry has adopted the use of OpenMM. More editorializing, but my graduate work never brought me into tight overlap with the OpenMM world/community, but it certainly seems like a vibrant community that is pushing the development and popularity of molecular modelling and simulation"

    "I'm mainly summarizing and regurgitating the [OpenMM documentation](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/library.html#the-openmm-public-api). These are some important terms to know within the OpenMM API:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **System** - this object stores information about numbers of particles, particle masses, box information, constraints, and virtual site information. Note the lack of positions, bonding information, integrators, simulation run parameters. The **System** object also contains your **Forces**.\n",
    "* **Force** - **Force** objects describe how your particles interact with each other. This is where your force field gets implemented - outlining the molecular model forces in play, the treatment of long range interactions, and even your barostat. This is, broadly, what a **Force** object is, but there is much more in the details of specific **Force** objects, like an `openmm.HarmonicBondForce`.\n",
    "    * Upon implementation, it's interesting to note that the \"Container\" is the **Force** object, and it contains the parameters and particles the obey this force. Sort of turning this concept upside-down, Parmed's atoms and bonds are the objects that contain the interaction parameters of that force.\n",
    "from a **Context** \n",
    "* **Integrator** - This is the integration algorithm by which you progress your particle's positions and simulation over time.\n",
    "* **Context** - this object stores information about your particle coordinates, velocities, and specially-defined/parametrized **Forces**. When you run an actual simulation or produce a trajectory, you will have to start from a **Context**. **Contexts** contain information about integrators, which helps distinguish information about your molecular model of your **System** (forces, masses) from the things that will be used to run your simulation.\n",
    "* **State** - this is like a single frame/snapshot/checkpoint within your simulation. It's everything that was being calculated at that particular timestep. If you want peer into your simulation, you will be looking at its **State**. If you want to report some information, you will be parsing information from the **State**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous tutorials on running OpenMM simulations, but I want to focus on building the OpenMM objects and everything before you need to think about **Integrators** or **States**, as this is key for builting interoperability between molecular modelling software."

It has well-designed classes wrapped in convenience API for users, while supporting hardware/GPU acceleration with minimial user effort. This may just be me, but I found learning the \"vocabulary\" and distinction between the base classes was a little hard to understand, but this kind of issue addresses itself over time if one plays around with the API. I am interested to investigate how well one can use OpenMM to build a variety of molecular models and how OpenMM can interface with interconversion libraries such as ParmEd to facilitate engine-flexibility. The devil is always in the details, so building your molecular model in OpenMM or ParmEd is always going to require due diligence to ensure correct output."
