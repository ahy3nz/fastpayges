    "Almost every molecular modelling software will have some API to support harmonic bonds, harmonic angles, Lennard-Jones nonbonded interactions, and Coulombic nonbonded interactions. Pretty widely implemented, but maybe not as commonly implemented, periodic (CHARMM) dihedrals and Ryckaert-Bellemans/OPLS dihedrals. In a highly developmental field like molecular modelling, scientists will often come up with unique functional forms to express some sort of interaction. These unique functional forms could be hard to incorporate into traditional molecular simulation software; how do you incorporate them into middle-men molecular modelling API in a manner that is **quick (quick to merge a PR) and reliable (just because the intermediate API can interpret a particular type of molecular model, how can you verify it converts well to another engine)**? How do we make molecular modelling packages **\"future-proof\"** in this regard?"

    "## OpenMM NonbondedForces\n",
    "Before we look at the `openmm.CustomNonbondedForce`, let's look at the `openmm.NonbondedForce`. \n",
    "The `openmm.NonbondedForce` encompasses Lennard-Jones and Coulombic interactions. Not only that, it handles the treatment of these interactions (Long range treatments: cutoff, switching functions, PME, reaction field, and LJPME; Bonded exceptions: 1-2 exceptions, 1-3 exceptions, 1-4 exceptions and their scale factors). Note: if I refer to a \"nonbonded interaction\", I am referring to the Coulombic (QQ) + Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will avoid talking about long range treatments, but that is a very \"sensitive\" subject - molecular simulations can be very touchy to your long range treatment, every engine might do it differently, and many force fields prescribe different long range treatments, do your reading!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover bonded exceptions as it pertains to building a molecular model. 1-2 interactions (nonbonded interactions between two particles that are directly bonded) are generally ignored by most force fields, and the only interaction is the bond interaction. The 1-2 exceptions mean the nonbonded interaction is neglected between two bonded atoms. 1-3 exceptions (two particles separated by a middle particle, think the H-H nonbonded interaction in H-O-H) are also generally ignored by most force fields. 1-4 exceptions are different; the Coulombic interactions can be scaled by an amount \\[0.0, 1.0\\), while the Lennard-Jones interactions can be scaled by another amount \\[0.0, 1.0\\). These scalings can be called fudge factors, 14 scalings, or something else, but be sure to follow the correct 14 scalings as prescribed by your force field. More on that later\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the `openmm.NonbondedForce`, I have links to their documentation below. With the `NonbondedForce`, you create the `Force` object, but then you have to start specifying the entities for which the force will apply in addition to the parameters by which the force will behave. An example: you have to call `NonbondedForce.addParticle(charge, sigma, epsilon)` to specify the QQ and LJ parameters. If you call `addParticle` for the i-th time, you will be specifying nonbonded parameters for the i-th particle. So you will have to add nonbonded parameters sequentially, in order with how your chemical system is ordered. \n",
    "Later, you can call `Nonbondedforce.setParticleParameters(index, charge, sigma, epsilon)` to specify parameters for the i-th particle. Cross interactions are never specified as they are **assumed to follow Lorentz-Berthelot** (we will see how to get around this later). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are functions for `Nonbondedforce.addException(int particle1, int particle2, double chargeProd, double sigma, double epsilon, replace=False)` to specify particle pairs who are exceptions to the rules - this will add an exception for a specific particle pair. To generally/globally add exceptions across your whole molecular model, you can call `Nonbondedforce.createExceptsionFromBonds((int,int) bonds, coulomb14scale, lj14scale)`. This is more convenient as the 1,4 exceptions are universal for a given molecular model under a particular force field.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how parmed translates parmed nonbonded parameters into openmm nonbonded parameters [go to their createSystem method](https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd/blob/7e411fd03c7db6977e450c2461e065004adab471/parmed/structure.py#L2554).
