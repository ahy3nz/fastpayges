<p>A streamlit dashboard that compares your fantasy basketball category league matchups, helping you figure out which categories you’re winning and which categories you might need help with</p>

<h1 id="fantasy-basketball-category-leagues">Fantasy basketball category leagues</h1>

<p>My fantasy basketball league switched from a points league to a <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-basketball-draft-cheat-sheet-for-category-leagues-211118357.html#:~:text=The%20eight%20default%20categories%20are,cat%20and%209%2Dcat%20leagues">categories league</a> this season.
The entire strategy has changed because you can’t solely rely on people who score a lot of points; you’re concerned about all the other box stats (FG%, FT%, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, points, 3-pointers made, turnovers).
So here are a couple of thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For most people, no one has a strong sense of who performs well in which categories, besides points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you compete against a new player each week, you don’t know how your <em>opponent</em> will perform in each category, and you especially don’t know which categories are easy victories, possibly winnable, or downright impossible to win</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a couple of streaming spots to pick up a player from the waiver wire, it would be nice to be informed of who is the correct waiver wire pickup. Not only will player news/injuries shake up waiver wire, but you might also want to consider if you should prioritze rebounds, steals, blocks, FG%, or 3PM, as a waiver wire pickup might be crucial to swinging a category your way</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-problem">The problem</h1>

<p>In the perfect algorithmic approach, we’d have some automated decisionmaking framework to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand our opponent’s performance for the upcoming week
    <ul>
      <li>Who is injured?</li>
      <li>How many games is each player playing?</li>
      <li>Do the NBA matchups affect performance?</li>
      <li>What are our opponents’ strengths and weaknesses?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Understand our performance for the upcoming week.
    <ul>
      <li>Same as above</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What categories are we definitely winning?</li>
  <li>What categories are we definitely losing?</li>
  <li>What categories will be competitive?</li>
  <li>Who is the pickup to swing the category in our favor?</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, this is a hard problem. 
Okay, it might not be <em>impossible</em>, but for a hobbyist this can be a little cumbersome as it requires factoring in a lot of different variables that might not be easily accessible.</p>

<p>To reduce the problem, we can focus on the parts that would be easy to resolve with a program:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Things that don’t require lots of logic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Things that are basically number farming</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-approximate-solution">The approximate solution</h1>

<p>Basically, what we’re looking for is <em>information</em> that could help us make a decision.</p>

<p>Over the course of data work, this is somewhat common: we have a lot of complex business logic that relies on a lot of information. 
The decisionmaking is hard to automate, but the data pulling is a very achievable task.
This work boils down to reporting, dashboarding, analytics, etc.</p>

<p>So this approach is a dashboard that leverages Streamlit and <a href="https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api">ESPN API</a> to predict your fantasy team’s statline for a given time period (how many rebounds will I score from 2022-01-01 to 2022-01-08? what will my FG% look like?).
Also, you can generally assess your team’s composition (and other teams’) to figure out which trades you might want to make.</p>

<p>If you need help with blocks, you might want to swap your waiver wire 3 pt specialist for a rim-defending center.
If there’s a team weak in steals, and your team is overwhelmingly strong in steals, you could try to trade a steals person to rebalance your steals in favor of another category in which you are weak.</p>

<h1 id="technical-commentary">Technical commentary</h1>

<p>ESPN API was fairly straightforward to use.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Pulling your fantasy basketball league’s details will definitely require credentials, so there’s this added requirement of passing certain ESPN fantasy cookies. I hadn’t figured out a way to automate this, but that’s fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s reassuring that this doesn’t require passing literal usernames and passwords, but instead, some relatively harmless cookies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The API includes a team’s schedule and different estimates for a player’s stats, making it possible to do some primitive projections of box stats. Predicting stats is a rabbit hole that knows no bounds, so I did some basic averaging of last season’s stats, this season’s stat projections, and this season’s current performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s also injury status, which means you can be very honest about your team’s performance in the face of unfortunate player news.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s some noncohesion between team identifying information (is it a 3-letter abbreviation or an integer code?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike <a href="https://github.com/ahy3nz/yellowtail">redfin requests</a>, I didn’t find my IP address blacklisted</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The choice of dashboarding was Streamlit</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easy to deploy to some perpetually-available server. Just provide a github repo</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t have to worry about the specifics of the server, just the python code and associated dependencies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Publicly accessible URLs (so you can do fantasy research from home or at work…)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Free</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally very easy to quickly prototype and see the resultant dashboard</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cooperates with pandas dataframe styling well</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, maintaining state was kind of weird.
What does state refer to? 
Generally, state refers to a sort of context and context-dependent variables that dictate what actions can be performed or how actions should be conducted.
In this case, state refers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the fantasy basketball league we’re looking at (the cookies you passed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, streamlit generally re-runs the dashboard python script everytime an input is changed. 
However, sometimes you don’t want to re-run the script upon every input change, only when a set of inputs change simultaneously:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What time period are you examining?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which teams are you examining?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you want to include the questionable/day-to-day players in the projections?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Streamlit has addressed some considerations of <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/session-state">state</a> so you can preserve your fantasy cookies between dashboard refreshes.
Streamlit has also included <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-submit-button-and-forms/">forms</a> that delay re-computation until a button is pressed.
In practice, this manifested in the code as a lot of if statements and nested code.</p>

<p>As far as evaluating any technology goes, the gist is: yeah it works. Sure, it has some flaws/friction points, but we can make it work. And we’re not looking for perfection, we just want something we can quickly build upon and iterate.</p>

<p>Has it helped? 
I’m in 2nd place in my fantasy basketball league, and I think some of these insights helped me make pickups to win a couple of extra categories.
At the very least, I’m no longer flying blind into each week of fantasy matchups.</p>
